ScheduleBell Backend
This project is designed to allow for easier scheduling of employees for companies without the resources or determination to invest in larger scheduling systems. This software is also designed to allow for employees to work at multiple locations across the organization. The other main object of this project is to make it as easy as possible for managers to accommodate employees personal schedules by allowing them to set their availability in the app and requires and override from the manager to schedule them outside of those times, to hopefully allow employees to increase their work life balance.
